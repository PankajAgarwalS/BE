"""


The Fractional Knapsack Problem allows breaking items into fractions to maximize profit while staying within the knapsackâ€™s capacity. The solution uses a greedy algorithm, where items are sorted by their profit-to-weight ratio, and then added to the knapsack in that order. If an item can't fit entirely, its fraction is added based on the remaining capacity.
time complexity is O(n log n).
